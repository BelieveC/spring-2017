## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
The current community I am a part of is hackers at Sussex University.
Ideally this will grow to a community in and around Brighton (to connect the two universities in that area).
  
### Size
The community is about 20 or so people, with low activity and low engagement.
I would ideally like to see a larger number of students to get involved with more frequent events to foster engagement.
The group is still less than a year old, probably 6 months and has been lacking in community leaders.
Currently - I have no idea how to grow it.

### Resources
Hackathon society, occasional meetups sdsdj shdui , maybe a hackathon.
I would like to see hardware resources and hardware and software workshops.

### Accessibility
Society is accessable to students of Sussex, meetup isn't run by students

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
- How much does it cost to use the space?
- How many people can it fit?
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
- What happens if there is a disagreement?- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?

- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
- How will you personally handle it?
