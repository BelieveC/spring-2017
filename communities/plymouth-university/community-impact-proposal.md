# Plymouth University Community Impact Proposal

This impact proposal has been created from initial [Community Assessment for Plymouth University](./community-assessment.md).

## Summary of the Community's Needs

### Demographics

Plymouth University is filled with many people from all different backgrounds. So far in this community it seems to mostly be people on computer science related courses such as a Comp. Games, Comp. Networking, Comp. Sci, etc. These courses at the university are also rather male dominated, though I have noticed slow movement over the years towards a more gender balanced community.

All the students are studying for honours degrees or higher, making them educated although you do get a wide range of abilities and experience with regard to programming in particular. Many freshers come in with no programming experience which does seem to make events somewhat difficult to run.

### Communication

Currently the existing tech communities in the uni seem to gravitate towards facebook, however in large groups or pages the interaction seems to lower interaction. Most of the general chit-chat seems to happen on small group chats or on the few discord channels floating around. It seems that for event organisation, facebook is the main platform as well.

It would be good to get some sort of central hub of chatter going on with tech based folk at the university. Somewhere that people can share new finds and discuss news as well as advertise their own projects.

### Culture

The community is slowly suffering from a decrease in passiation and increase in apathy. According to lecturers, even attendance to lectures has decreased signficiantly over the past few years. It seems for some reason students are unwilling to turn up to both required and optional content.

The culture at core has mostly lost all buzz and excitement. Finding a highly visible platform to centre discussion around would be a fantastic way to slowly revive the culture.

## The Proposal :ring:

I'm in a bit of an odd situation, the first being a scattered community and the second is I'm graduating this year and so I won't be around to enact a huge amount of change myself. After talking with Joe we decided it might be a good idea to find some folks to pick up the torch and begin handing over to them and potentially mentoring a little bit.

I was also put in touch with an ex-leader of a previous large society in Plymouth. The number piece of advice they gave was to stay well away from the Students Union and ensure any new societies are not setup under them, and instead remain under a faculty.

### Communication and Organisation

The idea would be to form a new facebook page (rather than a group) and begin trying to generate high quality, high signal discussion to form a small culture which we can then grow. This page would be spearheaded by the new community leaders, allowing them to brand it and mold it into their own foundation.

### Goals ðŸ¥…

* Identify new budding community leaders.
* Pull together material to aid them in reforging the community such as:
    * A brief history of the community and the current trajectory.
    * Tips on navigating various university social structures (which staff are active and willing to get involved, how to avoid the students union, etc).
    * Contact details for key players in any remaining tech pockets (Plymouth Game Devs, etc).
* Work with them to plan some next steps for the community within the first semester of the 2017/18 academic year.

## Impact :punch:

The following are the community needs listed in a slightly clearer format, next to each need are details of how the proposal will meet this need or reasons for why it is not within the scope.

* **Injection of more varied learning materials** - This is to address the issue where freshers come in with very little practical knowledge making it hard for them to get heavily involved with events like hackathons. Sadly this is _outside of the scope_ but should be generated as a biproduct of more discussion.
* **A low noise, high signal communication platform** - This is _within scope_ and going to be one of the core focuses of the project. It should provide a solid media platform for the community to come together in an async format, discussing things that interest them and ignoring the pieces that don't. Through this it should also provide a platform for the community to build new events and reach reach the wider global population with good visibility into what it is doing.
    * Within this it'll be important to ensure that the community is branded in a friendly but energetic form. This will help form the undelying culture we wish to promote within the universities tech community.
* **Engaging lower years within the Honours courses** - It's important that we find some enthusiastic students who are further back in their degrees so that they can begin to grow this community over the course of a few years rather than trying to rush for a one year run before they move on as well. This should hopefully bring a more even balance community demographics as these lower years seem to have a better balance of backgrounds.

### Rough timeline

As there is little time left in the year, some of this may span over the summer or into the next year. The following are a number of steps which might be used to achieve this vision and accomplish the project, though they are likely to change as things progress.

1. Identify some budding community leaders - This should be done before the summer, so preferably within the **next 2-3 weeks**. I'll do this by approaching lecturers and other key staff to try and identify some students who seem to be natural leaders within their groups. Beyond this I'll also reach out within the current GDSoc (Game Dev Soc) and the few other pockets to see if there are people who might share the same vision. _If this must be delayed until after the summer, all will not be lost as this will open up a new pool of freshers who might be up for the challenge._
2. Begin forming new discussion platform - Ideally this would take place during the summer, so that content can culture can build up within the platform. The idea would be to have the community leaders invite those they know that would interested in joining the community, but not pushing for high numbers and instead focusing on good discussion. **This is dependant on the first stage**.
3. Begin advertising and recruitment - Once the leaders have made the platform their own and figured out how they wish to use it, it would then be the time to begin attacting new members. This would be largely down to the students that year, but a possible approach to this could be organising a hackathon or mini-conference which is open to all within the university. This would kick off things off as a public group and begin to draw in new people who might be interested in joining the community.

## The future :crystal_ball:

Pretty much this entire proposal stems beyond the 8 week programe. So the main thing to focus on here is success measures. While much of this depends on the new leadership which steps forward, here are some initial success measures which could be used.

1. A group is established with some core values and aims considered.
2. Interest by one or more students in taking on the campus expert training to succeede myself.
3. New knowledge being delivered by students to each other.
4. Regular high quality discussion taking place via the communication platform.

Beyond Plymouth as I move forward, I'll be moving to Bristol as a software engineer at Gradient. This will give me a chance to connect in with Bristol Uni and try and hook in a few students to the Campus Expert programme to pass on the tourch for the south west.
