### Spring 2017 Repo

The [Spring 2017 Repo](https://github.com/campus-experts/spring-2017) is your cohort's repository (you're looking at it now!). You'll use this repo to access all program resources like the schedule of activities, but you can also open issues with questions or bugs you find. As you develop artifacts throughout the program, you'll also open Pull Requests against this repo to collaborate with other Campus Experts.

### Your Fork

During week 1, you'll be directed to fork the Spring 2017 repo into your personal account. Your forked repo will house your program artifacts. You'll solicit feedback from other Campus Experts via a Pull Request against the Spring 2017 Repo.

### Office Hours

Office hours will be hosted [on Zoom](https://github.zoom.us/j/4245140792) each week. We've scheduled a variety of office hours each week, providing options for each major time zone. You don't need to attend all of the office hours each week, but you should attend at least one. In the event that you are unable to attend one of the office hours, a recording will be made available. Some weeks (like Week 1) will contain structured content. Other weeks will contain unstructured time for Q&A with the facilitators and other Campus Experts. Although some of the office hours are titled by region, you can attend whichever event is convenient for you.

Zoom is a video conferencing tool. We choose Zoom as it makes great recordings, and has some features to facilitate group discussions. You can find out more about it [here](http://zoom.us). If you have difficulty using the Zoom app, you can also phone into the office hours from any number, instructions are in the calendar invite.

You can see the calendar below, where you can add or copy events to your own calendar:

Additional office hours may be held to accommodate guest speakers. Recording of these office hours will also be made available.

### Slack Channel

You've already received an invitation to the [GitHub Education Slack channel](http://githubeducation.slack.com). When joining the Slack, please set your username to your GitHub username. Use this space to have synchronous-ish discussions with other Campus Experts and facilitators. This is **your** space.

Discussions about the training will take place in #ce-spring-2017, and announcements related to all Campus Experts will be made in #campus-experts-public.

### Facebook Group

There is an optional Facebook group where we cross post announcements and news. It's meant to be an easier place to get notifications for those of you who use Facebook every day, but discussions and content will still primarily be on Slack and the repo. You can request membership [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1276763579081259/).
